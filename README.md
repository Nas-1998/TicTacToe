I created a X and O game.
it runs in CLI.
I used a similar structure to my Rock Paper Scissors game 
The user must select either X or O and then the CPU will automatically select the other one
The user is then asked to select a row and column to input their position and then the CPU will also automatically select an 
unselected position in the array.
The agme logic then checks each row, column and diagonal to see if any of them match and then that is checked against the human or CPU to decide a winner.
The game loops until a winner is found and if a position cant be placed the program loops until a correct position is placed
